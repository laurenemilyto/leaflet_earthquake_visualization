## About This Project
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment and the impacts of climate and land-use change. USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

This project uses D3, Leaflet, Mapbox and HTML are used to create an interactive map that plots all of the earthquakes from USGS GeoJSON data. Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. 

## Technology
- JavaScript
- Leaflet
- Mapbox
- D3
- HTML
- JSON

## Map
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger. Earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. When a marker is clicked, popups provide additional information about the earthquake.


## Data Source
